{"name":"FI-WARE  Data Handling GE - PPL","tagline":"This is PPL, an implementation of FI-WARE Data Handling Generic Enabler, please check for more information: http://wiki.fi-ware.eu/","body":"# Welcome to PPL, the FI-WARE Data Handling GE reference implementation.\r\n\r\nThis project hosts the source code of PPL. This code has been developed thanks to the support of the FI-WARE project, an initiative funded by the European Commission. Please refer to the [FI-WARE website](http://www.fi-ware.org) for more information. \r\n\r\nThe Data Handling GE mainly focuses on revealing certain attributes according to specific privacy and security conditions. It supports integrated data handling, in particular through two-sided detailed data handling, that takes into account specific preferences/policies expressed using the PPL language, based on XACML. Data usage purpose must always be declared, as it is a relevant part of the policy that must be expressed, as well as downstream usage, i.e., whether one can disclose collected data with third parties. The PPL language supports the enforcement of a number of obligations, that are bound tightly to data. For instance, one can impose a specific retention period, as well as the production of user's notifications and/or logging under certain conditions. \r\n\r\nPPL is an implementation of the Data Handling GE specification.\r\n\r\n### Why do I need PPL?\r\n\r\nWhen private and sensitive data is sent and stored into external web or cloud servers, there is no real control by the data owner. This lack of control is due to the absence of mechanisms and methods that provides access and usage control to the stored data during its life time. PPL provides the framework and the necessary tool to give the control to the data owner by imposing obligations on the data and restrictions.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n### Quick Reference Guide\r\n\r\nPPL can be used with a standard web browser, through a simple web application interface:\r\n* [http://datahdl.testbed.fi-ware.eu:8080/ppl-webapp/](http://datahdl.testbed.fi-ware.eu:8080/ppl-webapp/) (Secure File Store Service use case)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPPL offers a REST API that is documented at the [Data Handling REST API page](http://forge.fi-ware.eu/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/FIWARE.OpenSpecification.Security.DataHandlingGE.Open_RESTful_API_Specification).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe REST API of PPL is directly accessible at the following REST endpoint: [http://datahdl.testbed.fi-ware.eu:8080/ppl-rest/](http://datahdl.testbed.fi-ware.eu:8080/ppl-rest/)\r\n\r\nIt is possible to begin using PPL from the Data Subject ReSTful API, using a simple method with no input parameters. The Data Handling GE API page contains more information about methods exposed by PPL service of Data Handling GE.\r\n\r\nThe following method retrieves a list of available PIIs (Personal Identifiable Information) of Data Subjects. One could verify that the list is coherent with what shown in the HTML frontend, available at http://datahdl.lab.fi-ware.eu:8080 , where it is also possible to add new PIIs. The method is:\r\n`\r\nhttp://datahdl.testbed.fi-ware.eu:8080/ppl-rest/\r\n`\r\nExecution log using cURL:\r\n\r\n```\r\n About to connect() to  port 8080(#0)\r\n*   Trying ... connected\r\n* Connected to  ( IP) port 9477 (#0)\r\n> GET /api/pii HTTP/1.1\r\n> User-Agent: curl/7.21.3 (i686-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.21.3 OpenSSL/0.9.8o zlib/1.2.3.4 libidn/1.18\r\n> Host: :8080\r\n> Accept: */*\r\n> \r\n left intact\r\n* Closing connection #0\r\n[a list of  nodes, or nothing if no PIIs are inserted]\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Manuals\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [Data Handling FI-WARE page](http://forge.fi-ware.eu/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/Materializing_Security_in_FI-WARE#Data_Handling_Generic_Enabler) and especially to [Data Handling User and Programmer Guide](http://forge.fi-ware.eu/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/Data_Handling_GE_-_User_and_Programmer_Guide) for more information.\r\n\r\n## Want to know more?\r\n\r\nMore information can be found on the Open Specification pages, available at the [FI-WARE website](https://forge.fi-ware.eu/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/FIWARE.OpenSpecification.Security.Data_Handling_Generic_Enabler). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authors \r\nSlim Trabelsi, slim.trabelsi@sap.com\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
